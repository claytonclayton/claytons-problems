UNSW mandated competitive plate spinning course COMP412-plate is holding a nerve-wracking contest to test the limits of their plate spinning cohort. 

To begin their performances, students will select one of their plates, spin it, take one second to find their next plate, and then spin that, cycling through their choice of plates making sure none of them stop spinning and fall over. 

Big plates require more effort to spin. A plate with a radius of $r_i$ will spin for $100 - r_i$ seconds after being spun. If the plate is spun again any time within its $100 - r_i$ second spin it will continue to spin for another $100 - r_i$ seconds. 

Given a choice of $n$ plates what is the largest subset of plates you can guarantee to spin continuously without any falling over? Of these subsets, return a subset with the minimal largest plate.
